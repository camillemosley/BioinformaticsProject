#The Code for Daniel Gatewood, Mark Jantz, and Mae Czerwiec for the Bash Bioinformatics Project

#Usage: ls proteomes | bash projectcode.sh "hsp" "mcrA"
#Usage cont: the assumption is made that the individual gene sequences to be referenced 
#are in a subdirectory titled ref_sequences and the proteome files to be referenced are 
#in a subdirectory of the current working directory titled proteomes
#Usage cont: it is also assumed that the muscle and hmm files are in a sister directory to the current working directory titled tools

#This command makes a variable that lists all the protomes which need to be searched
list=$(cat)

#this for loop takes all the sequences of both genes of interest and prepares one fasta file containing them all, forwarding it to muscle for alignment, and then forwarding that to hmmbuild to create the hmm
for GeneAlign in $@

#the following is a for loop which performs hmmsearch for each proteome in the standard-in and outputs the number of hsp and mcrA genes in each proteome and inputs those values into a csv file../tools/bin/hmmsearch --tblout $1.output $1.hmm proteomes/$prot
